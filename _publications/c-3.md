  ### Abstract
  Internet of Things and robotic systems are widespread in many application domains. The emergence of the Internet of Robotic Things seeks to combine both technologies’ strengths, thus empowering the system with enhanced capabilities. Nevertheless, this system is composed of heterogeneous devices that need to communicate to work properly. To guarantee effective communication among the devices, we propose a model-driven approach that enables the integration of quality of service policies in communication among Internet of Robotic Things system devices, while ensuring their compatibility at the design time. We apply our approach in a smart agriculture scenario.
