### Abstract
The management of IoT systems is often challenging, requiring advanced skills, especially in ensuring loosely coupled coordination of heterogeneous devices. Model-driven approaches facilitate modeling, enacting, and monitoring interacting IoT devices’ behavior. Indeed, the state of the art provides contributions addressing crucial aspects of the model-driven approach applied to IoT systems. This chapter explores how to exploit the BPMN notation to manage IoT systems, focusing on a case study concerning a smart agriculture IoT system. Finally, we point to possible directions for future work.
