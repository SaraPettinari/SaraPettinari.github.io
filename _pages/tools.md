## FaMe
FaMe is a BPMN-driven framework for multi-robot system development. It allows the definition of a robotic mission using BPMN collaborations and the execution of the system exploiting the ROS2 framework.

## TALE
The TALE tool integrates the tag-based multi-perspective methodology which aims to support the robotic developer in the automatic extraction of multi-perspective event logs from the execution of a robotic system and analyze them through process mining. The tool enables the visualization of the analysis results from both behavioral and spatial perspectives.
