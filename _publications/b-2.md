### Abstract
Robotic systems are increasingly used in different application domains to support and automatize complex activities. The behavioral process of these systems, referred to as mission, defines the sequence of tasks enabling both robot actions and interactions. Since they can act autonomously in the environment, analysis techniques are crucial to ensure mission integrity and prevent system failures. In this context, process mining techniques can leverage data generated during robot activities to discover and analyze a robotic mission. However, robotic systems executions are characterized by a dynamic context and behavioral abilities that strongly impact the system analysis. This chapter examines the characteristics of robotic systems and discusses their interplay with process mining to foster the effective application of process mining. It aims to identify the primary challenges and outline future research opportunities.
