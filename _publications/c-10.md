### Abstract
As digital systems become an integral part of modern organizations, ethical considerations must also be incorporated within the business process management domain. While this domain has traditionally focused on system-level goals, such as efficiency, security, and compliance, individual-level ethical aspects, such as human preferences, well-being, and dignity, remain largely unexplored. This paper introduces the concept of ethical-aware business processes, which are capable of integrating
both system-level obligations and individual ethical values. Focusing on autonomous systems guided by a process model, we explore the challenges of designing, implementing, and monitoring processes that ensure respectful and responsible interactions with humans. We also outline key research directions to enable the management of ethical-aware business processes across their lifecycle.
