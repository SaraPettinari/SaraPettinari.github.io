I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Gran Sasso Science Institute [(GSSI)](https://gssi.it/), where I work under the HALO project (ethical-aware adjustable autonomous systems).

Before this, I was a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Camerino, where I defended my thesis titled: "Process-driven Development and Analysis of Multi-Robot Systems".

My research focuses on business process management and process mining, particularly on the development and analysis of robotic system missions. Additionally, my work explores the integration of ethical aspects in the design and development of autonomous systems.
