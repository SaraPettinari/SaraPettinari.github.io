I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Gran Sasso Science Institute [(GSSI)](https://gssi.it/), where I work under the HALO project (ethical-aware adjustable autonomous systems).

Before this, I was a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Camerino, where I defended my thesis titled: "Process-driven Development and Analysis of Multi-Robot Systems".

My research focuses on Business Process Management and Process Mining, with a particular interest in developing and analyzing IoT and Robotic systems.
